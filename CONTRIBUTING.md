# Contributing

This repository is designed to match the internal style guidelines that
[The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/) have for their reports and projects,
but if you have any recommendations for improvements please feel free to
[create an issue](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/StrategyUnitTheme/issues/new).

For Strategy Unit team members, note that you cannot directly commit to the master branch.
Please create any changes on a separate branch to master. Once you are ready, create a pull
request to merge your changes back into master. Before you create a pull request, ensure that:

- you have created unit tests (using [testthat](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html))
- travis ci builds successfully on your new branch
- the changes that you are making are not partial but are a finished piece of work
- changes have been signed off by managers or discussed with the team
